**Research Paper**: [AI-aided cardiovascular disease diagnosis in cattle from retinal images: Machine learning vs. deep learning models](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0168169924007828#:~:text=It%20has%20been%20shown%20that,diagnoses%20CVD%20with%2096.1%20%25%20accuracy.&text=Study%20findings%20prove%20that%20retinal,accurate%20aid%20in%20diagnosing%20CVD.&text=It%20contains%20information%20and%20findings%20on%20agriculture%20and%20animal%20husbandry%20development)

**Insights from the paper**

* It has been shown that the ResNet101 model successfully diagnoses CVD with 96.1 % accuracy.
* Study findings prove that retinal images can provide veterinarians with a rapid and accurate aid in diagnosing CVD.
* It contains information and findings on agriculture and animal husbandry development.

**Dataset**: [CVD vs. NonCVD Retinal Images of Cattle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/animalbiometry/cvd-vs-noncvd-retinal-images-of-cattle?resource=download)

**About dataset:**

* The RGB retinal images that constitute the dataset were captured using the Optomed Smartscope digital fundus camera.
* A total of 1,118 images were collected from the right and left eyes of 100 cattle.
* The images have a resolution of 1536x1152 pixels and are in JPG format.
* Among the 100 cattle, 52 were diagnosed with Cardiovascular Disease (CVD), and 48 were non-CVD.
* 0: non-CVD (527 retinal images), 1: CVD (591 retinal images)
